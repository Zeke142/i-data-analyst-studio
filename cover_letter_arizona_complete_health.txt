Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m writing to express my interest in the Grievance & Appeals Coordinator I position at Arizona Complete Health. My background in computer systems, paired with hands-on experience building analytical workflows and learning platforms quickly, makes me a strong fit for this data-focused and process-driven role.

I hold an Associate Degree in Computer Science and have developed a working portfolio that includes Excel-based dashboards, SQL queries, and reporting workflows. I’m highly adaptable, detail-oriented, and thrive in structured digital environments. Whether working in a CRM, case management, or reporting system, I learn quickly and focus on accuracy.

Attached is my resume and sample portfolio. I’d be honored to support your team and bring energy, clarity, and technical skill to this role.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Troy Farley
